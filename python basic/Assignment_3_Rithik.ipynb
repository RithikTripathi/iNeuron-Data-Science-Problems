    "Solution : There are several advantages of using a finction in program mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Reusability : Instead writing same block of code at multiple places, one can use a               function to simplyfy the task.\n",
    "    2. Readibility : functions make program more readable and appear less complex.\n",
    "    3. Updates : If a finction is called multiple places an we need to make changes and update          it, we can simply do in function body and it's done for all calls, which is not possible          without functions.\n",
